Chang: In the group discussion, I put forward a suggestion of 12 constellations. Our group was originally going to do the Chinese zodiac theme, but because it was not easy to understand, we chose 12 constellations. I was mainly responsible for finding constellation pictures, as well as the AR part. There are two people in our group, so each of us has more tasks assigned. Our plan is to complete a small portion of the week.

Almark: I totally agree with Changâ€™s point. We should focus on the twelve constellations as our central theme. At the same time, I think that in order to make the constellations more vividly displayed in AR scenes, we should add movement effects to the 3D models of the constellations. In addition, I think we should also try to make the UI as beautiful as possible artistically in terms of web production. This can give the viewers a better viewing experience.
